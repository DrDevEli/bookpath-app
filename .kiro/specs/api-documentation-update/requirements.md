# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BookPath API documentation needs to be reviewed and updated to accurately reflect the current implementation. There are discrepancies between the OpenAPI specification and the actual endpoints implemented in the codebase. This feature will ensure that the public API documentation is comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date with all available endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with BookPath API, I want accurate and complete API documentation, so that I can successfully implement features without encountering undocumented endpoints or incorrect specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I review the OpenAPI specification THEN it SHALL include all currently implemented endpoints
2. WHEN I check endpoint parameters THEN they SHALL match the actual implementation requirements
3. WHEN I examine response schemas THEN they SHALL accurately reflect the data structures returned by the API
4. WHEN I look at authentication requirements THEN they SHALL correctly indicate which endpoints require authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to understand which endpoints are public versus protected, so that I can properly implement authentication flows in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the documentation THEN public endpoints SHALL be clearly marked as not requiring authentication
2. WHEN I see protected endpoints THEN they SHALL clearly indicate the required authentication method
3. WHEN I check role-based endpoints THEN they SHALL specify the required user roles or subscription tiers
4. WHEN I review OAuth endpoints THEN they SHALL include proper flow documentation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all missing endpoints documented, so that I can utilize the full functionality of the BookPath API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check authentication endpoints THEN missing endpoints like 2FA setup, OAuth flows, and email verification SHALL be documented
2. WHEN I review user management THEN endpoints for profile management, preferences, and password changes SHALL be included
3. WHEN I examine collection management THEN book management endpoints within collections SHALL be documented
4. WHEN I look at utility endpoints THEN health checks, metrics, and cache management SHALL be documented

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want accurate request/response examples, so that I can properly format API calls and handle responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view endpoint documentation THEN request body schemas SHALL match the validation requirements
2. WHEN I check response examples THEN they SHALL reflect the actual response structure from controllers
3. WHEN I see error responses THEN they SHALL include all possible HTTP status codes and error formats
4. WHEN I review data types THEN they SHALL match the MongoDB schema definitions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want operational endpoints documented, so that I can monitor and manage the BookPath system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I check system endpoints THEN health check endpoint SHALL be documented with response format
2. WHEN I review monitoring THEN metrics endpoint SHALL be documented with authentication requirements
3. WHEN I examine cache management THEN cache statistics and reset endpoints SHALL be documented
4. WHEN I look at webhooks THEN Stripe webhook endpoint SHALL be properly documented
